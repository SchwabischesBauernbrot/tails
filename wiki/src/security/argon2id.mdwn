### Explanation

bruteforce to guess your passphrase
make some calculation on each try
how complicated and expensive is this calculation?
make each try of a different passphrase combination more expensive

PBKDF2 until Tails 5.13.

Argon2id since Tails 5.13.

Actually, not really a vulnerability but an arms race in terms of computer
resources available to crack passphrases while provide usable encryption.

### Likelihood

This vulnerability might have been used already against activists in France:

Persistent Storage and other encrypted volumes created with Tails 5.12 and
earlier could have been decrypted by very powerful adversaries with physical
access.

Only practical for an adversay with very powerful computers, lots of money and
time to spend, and very advanced technical team, like a State.

I like the conversion into dollars and time!

Diceware gives 13 bits of entropy per word.

We recommend 5 to 7 words.

If you followed our recommendations, you are safe. Congrats!

  - 6 words or more (78 bits or more)
    * Safe (even with 5.12 or earlier)
    * Would take several milleniums to crack your passphrase even with 5.12 or earlier

  - 5 words (65 bits)
    * 5.12 or earlier: safe unless your adversay can spend at least $500k on cracking your passphrase
    * 5.14 or later: safe

  - 3 or 4 words (39 or 52 bits)
    * 5.12 or earlier: not safe
    * 5.14 or later: safe
    * Still, consider boosting your passphrase to 5 words

If you use a different password scheme than diceware, sorry but we can't
estimate your safety. Consider changing to diceware.

### Mitigation

- Persistent Storage:

  Upgrade to Tails 5.14

  Tails 5.14 converts automatically your Persistent Storage to argon2id.

- Backup Tails USB stick:

  Use the new backup feature of Tails Installer to update the header of your
  backup Tails (and do a fresh copy of all your Persistent Storage).

- Other encrypted volumes:

  Create a new encrypted device and do a backup of all your data, or upgrade
  from the command line.

- Want to check?

  Persistent Storage:

      sudo cryptsetup luksDump /dev/sda2
