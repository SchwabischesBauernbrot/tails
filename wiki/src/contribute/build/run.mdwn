# Kernel options

 - `early_patch`: see [[contribute/build/early-patch]]
 - `login`: skip the greeter, using the default options

 - `rootpw` set the root password (not the amnesia password)

 - `break=init` stop boot before starting the init and give you a shell. Useful for small customizations that
   must be done before boot.
   If you need to do the same thing over and over, consider using [[contribute/build/early-patch]] instead
