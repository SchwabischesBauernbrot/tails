Recording with a camera using <span class="application">Cheese</span>
=====================================================================

Recording the screen with an external camera has the following
advantages over recording with a screencast:

- Recording a whole session, even if the user restarts Tails.
- Saving the video directly to your computer and not relying on the
  computer used for the tests.

You can use a document camera. The [Ziggi-HD Plus by
IPEVO](https://www.ipevo.com/) works fine from Tails.

1. Move the <span class="guilabel">AF</span> switch of the camera to <span class="guilabel">C</span> to have continuous autofocus.

1. Install *Cheese*:

   <p class="pre command">apt install cheese ffmpegthumbnailer</p>

1. In *Cheese*, choose **[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>&nbsp;▸
   Preferences** and adjust the video resolution to find a good trade-off
   between resolution and fluidity.

   On my ThinkPad X250, I use 1280 × 720.

1. Adjust the orientation of the camera to capture as much of the screen as
   possible while not obfuscating the light of sight of the participant.

Recording a screencast
======================

Recording the screen with a screencast has the following advantages over
recording with an external camera:

- Better image quality
- Lighter setup

Using GNOME Shell
-----------------

Press <span class="keycap">Ctrl+Alt+Shift+R</span> in GNOME to start or stop
capturing a screencast.

The video is saved to <span class="filename">~/Videos/</span>.

<div class="bug">

<p>Unfortunately, this screencast has no sound and more complete applications
like <i>Kazam</i> stopped working in Tails 5.8 (December 2022). Tails 6.0 (mid
2023) should integrate better screencast features. ([[!tails_ticket 19441]])<p>

<p>Until then, you can record the sound with <i>Sound Recorder</i>.</p>
