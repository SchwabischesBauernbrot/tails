# Duties

Core members of the [[Foundations Team|roles/foundations_team]]
are responsible for:

* publishing new Tails versions in a timely fashion, according to the
  schedule submitted by the [[Foundations Team|foundations team]];

* reaching a consensus regarding documenting, delaying, or releasing,
  when emergency releases might be warranted (usually prompted by
  unplanned Tor Browser releases for security issues that require
  urgent care);

* making sure automatic and manual testers are covered during each
  release process;

* being in the loop when major changes land in release branches, so
  that they can propose extra manual tests if those changes feel
  risky (e.g. changes in the upgrader code).

To ensure releasing is achievable in a timely manner, historically,
they have also been responsible for:

* making sure the various Git branches get successful builds and test
  suite runs in Jenkins, filing issues for the Foundations Team as
  needed.

This responsibility might get shifted to the Foundations Team in the
near future though.

Also historically, the Release Manager for a given Tails release deals
with integrating the target Tor Browser version, even if that's one of
the Foundations Team's duties.

<a id="shift"></a>

# Shift

## In the beginning of your shift

- Check the [Tor Browser release
  schedule](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/applications/tor-browser/-/wikis/Release-Schedule). `[skip-if-emergency-release]`. In doubt, check the [logs from their last meeting](http://meetbot.debian.net/tor-meeting/).

- Check the Mozilla release calendars: `[skip-if-emergency-release]`

  * [Google calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=mozilla.com_2d37383433353432352d3939%40resource.calendar.google.com)

  * [Release schedule](https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/)

- Reply to the email sent to <tails-dev@boum.org> and
  <tails-l10n@boum.org> by the RM for the previous release,
  to provide information they could not, if any, such as: `[skip-if-emergency-release]`

  - Code freeze date, if it's different from what's in the email sent by the previous RM.

  - If this will be a major release: the release schedule for its RC.

- Ask for a _Trusted Reproducer_:

        ./bin/generate-call-for-trusted-reproducer \
           --version VERSION_YOU_WILL_RELEASE

- Update [[contribute/calendar]] accordingly.

- Check if there's a
  [[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/milestones desc="GitLab milestone"]]
  with the correct due date. If it is not, create a merge request against
  [[!tails_gitlab tails/gitlab-config]] to fix it.

- Create an issue with the `Core Work: Foundations Team` label,
  about upgrading Tor Browser in the release your shift is about.

- Ensure there's [an issue about
  writing the release notes](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/tails/-/issues?scope=all&state=opened&label_name[]=Core%20Work%3ATechnical%20writing&search=release+notes). This also applies to betas and release
  candidates, so you might create multiple such issues during one
  shift. Set `Write release notes for $VERSION` as title.

- Verify there's a `missed:$VERSION` label
  on [[!tails_gitlab groups/tails/-/labels]]; if there's none,
  submit a MR against [[!tails_gitlab tails/gitlab-config]]
  to create one.

- The ISO images for *every* previous beta, RC, and final release
  based on the version of Debian that will be used for the release
  you'll be preparing.

  To get the list of images you'll need, run:

        ./bin/iuk-source-versions VERSION_YOU_WILL_RELEASE

  For example, if you're preparing 4.4, you need the ISO images
  for 4.0~beta1, 4.0~beta2, 4.0~rc1, 4.0, 4.1, 4.1.1, 4.2, 4.2.2, and 4.3.

  I.e. you can run this inside `isos.git`:

        git annex sync --no-content
        (cd ${TAILS_GIT_REPO:?}; ./bin/iuk-source-versions "${VERSION:?}" | tr ' ' '\n' | sed -e 's/^/tails-amd64-/') | xargs -r git annex get

- Ensure the next steps are tracked in your preferred personal
  organization tool.

## Two weeks after the beginning of your shift

- Ensure you have found a _Trusted Reproducer_ and write who this is
  in the [[contribute/calendar]].

- Check if you have enough manual testers registered.
  If not, ping the usual testers and warn the Foundations Team
  that you may need their help.

## The Friday before the release date

### Take care of TBB upgrade

Ask the Tor Browser developers when they expect they'll have
tarballs ready.

Rationale: we need to coordinate our Tails release with the Tor Browser
developers to make sure that the Tor Browser we plan to include in our
release is ready in time for when we build the release image. The
Friday prior to the release is a good candidate, since it's
around this time they usually release tarballs for testing, and it
will still give some time for us to improvise according to their
"delayed" schedule and arrange a contingency plan (e.g. possibly
delaying our release a day or two). Asking for a status report a day
or two earlier than Friday *in addition* won't hurt, too.

<div class="note">

Note: the Tor Browser team Cc's tails-dev@boum.org when sending QA
requests to tor-qa@lists.torproject.org which makes this easier.
We are also often notified of any last last-minute rebuilds, better
ask explicitly the Tor Browser team what their plans are.

</div>

As soon as the new *Tor Browser* tarballs are ready, you may import
them in a topic branch and trigger CI runs, which will save you
some precious time on pre-release Monday. See the
[[Upgrading the Tor Browser|contribute/release_process/tor-browser]]
page for details.

### Make sure your build setup works

This is not a mandatory step. However, it's suggested that you do this, especially if more than a week passed
since you build a Tails image.

You just need to make sure that `rake build` will work, so on Monday you can expect less glitches to happen.

## Make the release happen

No kidding. See [[contribute/release_process]].

# Emergency release

This section documents what differs, when preparing an emergency release,
from publishing a scheduled release.

### Making decisions

When an event prompts us to wonder whether we shall prepare an emergency
release, we have to make 2 decisions:

#### Will we publish an emergency release?

First, create an issue about this question. **Do not** leak
any information that was shared with us privately.

These stakeholders must be part of the decision-making process:

 - release managers: determine whether we have the capacity to prepare an
   emergency release, and when; privately share confidential information that
   other stakeholders need to do their job

 - developers i.e. Foundations Team: assess the risk that the emergency
   release would cancel or mitigate; propose mitigation measures that
   we could recommend to users.

   Sometimes (for example when a DSA for the Linux kernel is out) assessing the
   severity is quite of a long process, because the DSA page could reference
   dozens of CVEs. To simplify this, you can use [cve-scraper](https://gitlab.tails.boum.org/tails/cve-scraper/).
   Here is some good query to get you started:

     - `./bin/nvd-info.py search --vector 'AV:[^P]' --vector '[CI]:[MH]' "${listOfCVEs[@]}"`
     - `./bin/nvd-info.py search --description 'privileg|escalat' "${listOfCVEs[@]}"`

   Rules of thumb:

    - We usually do not prepare emergency releases for local privilege
      escalation (even to root) if they cannot be exploited from the
      execution context of Tor Browser.

 - UX: evaluate the acceptability of mitigation measures proposed by
   developers; remind everyone else that any extra upgrade has a UX cost

 - technical writers: determine whether we have the capacity
   to document mitigation measures, and when

If we decide to publish an emergency release, say so on the aforementioned
issue, then read on. Else, explain why on the aforementioned issue,
and close it with the _Rejected_ label.

#### When will we prepare and publish it? (if we decided to go ahead)

This mostly depends on the availability of release managers and manual
testers. Privately reach out to them, asking when they could do their part of
the work. Then, release managers make this decision.

### Additional steps

1. Move to the milestone that was just created for the emergency release
   every:

    - issue that was resolved
    - merge request that was merged

   â€¦ and that currently have the milestone of the next planned non-emergency
   bugfix release. In other words, since every change that is on the `stable`
   branch, but not released yet, will be released for the first time in this
   upcoming emergency release, it must have the milestone of that
   emergency release.

   This ensures the generated changelog will include these changes, and ensures
   we have a correct record of which release presumably fixed which bug (that's
   useful for example when triaging bug reports).

   To do so, on each of these 2 pages:

    - [[!tails_gitlab tails/tails/-/issues?state=closed desc="issues"]]
    - [[!tails_gitlab tails/tails/-/merge_requests?state=merged desc="merge requests"]]

   Do this:

   1. Filter by milestone = the next planned non-emergency bugfix release

   2. Click *Bulk edit*

   3. Select all items

   4. Set the milestone of the emergency release

2. Announce to <tails-dev@boum.org>:

    - There's an upcoming emergency release. Don't say why if it's a secret.

    - Announce the code freeze.

3. Announce to manual testers: when you expect the tests to happen

### Irrelevant steps

Steps that are not relevant for emergency releases are tagged
`[skip-if-emergency-release]`.

### Timing

By definition, an emergency release happens under timing constraints that are
different from a scheduled release. To account for this, ignore timing
indications below such as "Two weeks after" or "The Friday": assume everything
is relevant shall happen as soon as reasonably possible.
