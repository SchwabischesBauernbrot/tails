[[!meta  title="New domain: tails.net"]]

Today we finished the migration our website to a new domain. From now on, the
canonical website for the Tails project is: [[tails.net|https://tails.net]].
Please make sure to update any important pointers you may have or know about.

The new domain provides us shorter URLs and more autonomy and possibilities for
some technical work. The "old" `tails.boum.org`  domain will be kept around,
until further notice, to avoid breaking upgrades and security notifications on
older versions of Tails, as well as links on the Internet.

We want to thank `boum.org` for supporting the project and being our main
public face for the last 14 years. Their support was and continues to be very
valuable! :)
