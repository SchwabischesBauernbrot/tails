"*Dangerzone* is an essential tool and is built by great people. It was "
"first\n"
"written by [Micah Lee](https://micahflee.com/about/) to protect "
"investigative\n"
"journalists while working at [The Intercept](https://theintercept.com/).\n"
"*Dangerzone* is now maintained by [Freedom of the Press\n"
"Foundation](https://freedom.press), a non-profit that protects "
"public-interest\n"
"journalism. Edward Snowden and Laura Poitras are on its Board of "
"Directors.\n"

"It's totally the kind of software that aligns with [[our "
"mission|contribute/mission]]. The only reason why we are not including "
"*Dangerzone* in Tails by default is because *Dangerzone* is too big and not "

"So, we collaborated with Alex Pyrgiotis from Freedom of the Press Foundation "
"to make it as easy as possible to install *Dangerzone* in Tails as "
"[[Additional Software|doc/persistent_storage/additional_software]]. The "
"setup requires using the command line, but, after that, *Dangerzone* will "
"install automatically every time you start Tails."

"It's also the first time that we recommend installing a 3rd party package "
"that is not available in Debian. We know that a lot of software that would "
"be useful for our users is not readily available in Debian. If this first "
"experiment is successful, we might document more such packages."
