Dear {FIRSTNAME},

In this newsletter, we share inspiring stories of Tails users around the world,
privacy tips, and the latest from our team with our supporters.

# Help us shape the future of Tails!

In 2021&ndash;2023, we focused on improving the usability of core features of
Tails. We redesigned the [Tor Connection](https://tails.net/news/version_4.28)
to make it easier to circumvent censorship and the [Persistent
Storage](https://tails.net/news/version_5.8) to make it easier to store
encrypted data in Tails.

What shall we work on next?

Our team has identified the need for better communication tools as a priority
for our users. We are considering 2 main options:

- Make it possible to use a VPN instead of Tor in some cases
- Add support for better messaging applications

In the coming months, we will do some research to understand the needs of our
users and decide which of these features to work on first.

As a start, we wanted your opinion as supporters of Tails. Help us decide by
answering this 5-minute survey.

# Encryption is under attack in France, the UK, Spain, and the USA

French law enforcement now has the power to snoop by remotely controlling
unsuspecting people’s electronic devices. It’s not clear how they plan to
execute this. Perhaps they
[already](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/nsa-remotely-turn-on-phones,news-18854.html)
have? Of course, the Justice Minister has been adamant that this is
[nothing](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/07/06/france-set-to-allow-police-to-spy-through-phones_6044269_7.html)
like the surveillance society that Orwell described in 1984. And of course, the
lawmakers were quick to exempt themselves from the invasive law.

The French authorities aren't alone in wanting backdoors in digital devices. On
the other side of the English Channel, lawmakers in the United Kingdom are
about to mandate backdoors in all end-to-end encrypted messaging systems. The
proposed [Online Safety
Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137/publications) mandates private
messaging services to monitor the messages of users. This perpetual wiretap
will, allegedly, make the United Kingdom “[the safest place in the world to be
online while defending free
expression](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-bill-supporting-documents)”.
Similar moves are underway in
[Spain](https://www.wired.com/story/europe-break-encryption-leaked-document-csa-law/)
and the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EARN_IT_Act).

# Amidst repression in France, using Tails is not a crime

Back in France, digital surveillance of dissenting socio-political movements
had been intensifying for years now. Comrades in
[environmental groups](https://lessoulevementsdelaterre.org/blog/un-traceur-gps-retrouve-sous-le-vehicule-du-porte-parolede-bassines-non-merci),
or just at an [anarchist library](https://bibliothequelibertad.noblogs.org/post/2022/04/02/un-micro-trouve-a-la-bibliotheque-anarchiste-libertad/)
are being surveilled with military-grade equipment. As if that wasn’t enough,
the mere use of privacy-preserving tools like Tails and Tor is being treated as
evidence of criminal behaviour to muzzle dissenting political groups. In the
French senate, the Minister of Interior
[desired](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/2023/06/05/criminalization-of-encryption-the-8-december-case/)
the power to hack into the phones of environmental activists using Signal,
WhatsApp, or Telegram. In the “8 December” case, the suspects’ use of Tails,
and apparent distrust of GAFAM was used to support an already nebulous case.

In 2009, we created Tails exactly this context: so that activists wouldn't get
in troubles merely because of how they used computers.

In 2023, not much has changed. It’s saddening and enraging that digital privacy
and safety are rapidly getting out of reach. Tails’s mission as important now,
if not more, as it was 15 years ago.

On that note, we’d like to thank our sponsors:
[Nym](https://nymtech.net/),
[ThinkPenguin](https://www.thinkpenguin.com/),
[Look to the Right](https://looktotheright.com/),
[Exam Success](https://www.examsuccess.com.au/), and
[freiheitsfoo](https://freiheitsfoo.de/). They have all supported
our work over the last year, and have renewed their support. If you too would
like to sponsor Tails, get in touch with us at tails-fundraising@boum.org.

# Welcome to tails.net

Tails has a cool, new domain: <a href="https://tails.net/">tails.net</a>.

After 14 years of using a subdomain of `boum.org` , we finally found a new home
that will be easier for everybody to remember and type.

`tails.boum.org` will continue working while we migrate. Thank you to
`boum.org` , for supporting us all these years. Their support was and continues
to be very valuable!

# What we’re reading

* In India, the state of Manipur has spiralled into intense communal and ethnic
  conflict. A 3-month internet shutdown led to the silencing of the minority Kuki
  community. Internet access was permitted for people with broadband connections
  who undertook to only use static IP and not use any VPNs. Mobile internet
  remains inaccessible, and is the dominant way to access the internet for the
  Kuki community. The dystopian [undertaking](https://i.redd.it/g329xvb6ueeb1.jpg)
  makes for a <strike>fun</strike> chilling read.

* In [Surveillance: You can know too much](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2008/jun/17/surveillance.database),
  Cory Doctorow decries the intrusive data
  collection tendencies of law enforcement around the word. A seasoned advocate
  of individuals’ privacy rights and critic of surveillance capitalism, he argues
  that law enforcement doesn't know what to do with the data it already has. As
  countries around the world lust after collecting more and more data, this
  article is both prescient and timeless.

* And here’s something to keep an eye out for. A [guide](https://www.anarsec.guide/) is being built to resist
  the weaponization of digital tools by using some of your own.
