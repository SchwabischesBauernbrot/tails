Dear {FIRSTNAME},

In this newsletter, we share inspiring stories of Tails users around the world,
privacy tips, and the latest from our team with our supporters.

**Encryption is under attack.**

French law enforcement now has the power to snoop by remotely controlling
unsuspecting people’s electronic devices. It’s not clear how they plan to
execute this. Perhaps they
[already](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/nsa-remotely-turn-on-phones,news-18854.html)
have? Of course, the Justice Minister has been adamant that this is
[nothing](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/france/article/2023/07/06/france-set-to-allow-police-to-spy-through-phones_6044269_7.html)
like the surveillance society that Orwell described in 1984. And of course, the
lawmakers were quick to exempt themselves from the invasive law.

The French authorities aren't alone in wanting backdoors in digital devices. On
the other side of the English Channel, lawmakers in the United Kingdom are
about to mandate backdoors in all end-to-end encrypted messaging systems. The
proposed [Online Safety
Bill](https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/3137/publications) mandates private
messaging services to monitor the messages of users. This perpetual wiretap
will, allegedly, make the United Kingdom “[the safest place in the world to be
online while defending free
expression](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-bill-supporting-documents)”.
Similar moves are underway in
[Spain](https://www.wired.com/story/europe-break-encryption-leaked-document-csa-law/)
and the [United States of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EARN_IT_Act).

Back in France, digital surveillance of dissenting socio-political movements
had been intensifying for years now. Comrades in environmental groups
(https://lessoulevementsdelaterre.org/blog/un-traceur-gps-retrouve-sous-le-vehicule-du-porte-parolede-bassines-non-merci),
or just at an anarchist library
(https://bibliothequelibertad.noblogs.org/post/2022/04/02/un-micro-trouve-a-la-bibliotheque-anarchiste-libertad/)
are being surveilled with military-grade equipment. As if that wasn’t enough,
the mere use of privacy-preserving tools like Tails and Tor is being treated as
evidence of criminal behaviour to muzzle dissenting political groups. In the
French senate, the Minister of Interior
[desired](https://www.laquadrature.net/en/2023/06/05/criminalization-of-encryption-the-8-december-case/)
the power to hack into the phones of environmental activists using Signal,
WhatsApp, or Telegram. In the “8 December” case, the suspects’ use of Tails,
and apparent distrust of GAFAM was used to support an already nebulous case.

In 2009, we created Tails exactly this context: so that activists wouldn't get
in troubles merely because of how they used computers.

In 2023, not much has changed. It’s saddening and enraging that digital privacy
and safety are rapidly getting out of reach. Tails’s mission as important now,
if not more, as it was 15 years ago.

On that note, we’d like to thank our sponsors: Nym Technologies, Look to the
Right, Exam Success, Think Penguin ,and freiheitsfoo. They have all supported
our work over the last year, and have renewed their support. If you too would
like to sponsor Tails, get in touch with us at tails-fundraising@boum.org.

**VPN vs. messaging**

All Tails workers met earlier this year to plan improvements to the product and
the project. We decided to introduce one big feature this year, but can’t pick
between bringing VPN functionality to Tails or adding messaging tools.

Help us decide by sharing your preference in this survey:
https://survey.tails.boum.org/index.php/184541

We'll do the losing option next!

**Tails.net**

Tails has a cool, new domain: tails.net.

After 14 years of using a subdomain of `boum.org` , we finally found a new home
that will be easier for everybody to remember and type.

`tails.boum.org` will continue working while we migrate. Thank you to
`boum.org` , for supporting us all these years. Their support was and continues
to be very valuable!

**What we’re reading**

* In India, the state of Manipur has spiralled into intense communal and ethnic
  conflict. A 3-month internet shutdown led to the silencing of the minority Kuki
  community. Internet access was permitted for people with broadband connections
  who undertook to only use static IP and not use any VPNs. Mobile internet
  remains inaccessible, and is the dominant way to access the internet for the
  Kuki community. The dystopian [undertaking](https://i.redd.it/g329xvb6ueeb1.jpg)
  makes for a ~~fun~~ chilling read.

* In this article from 15 years ago, Cory Doctorow decries the intrusive data
  collection tendencies of law enforcement around the word. A seasoned advocate
  of individuals’ privacy rights and critic of surveillance capitalism, he argues
  that law enforcement doesn't know what to do with the data it already has. As
  countries around the world lust after collecting more and more data, this
  article is both prescient and timeless:

* And here’s something to keep an eye out for. A guide is being built to resist
  the weaponization of digital tools by using some of your own:
