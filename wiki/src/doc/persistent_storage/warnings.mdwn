Overwriting configurations
==========================

You can weaken your security or break some programs if you use the
Persistent Storage to overwrite their settings. The programs
included in Tails are carefully configured with security in mind.
Be especially careful when using the
[[Dotfiles|configure#dotfiles]] feature.

The anonymity of Tor and Tails relies on making it harder to
distinguish one Tails user from another. In some cases, changing the default
settings can break your anonymity.
