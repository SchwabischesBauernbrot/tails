Using the *Disks* utility
=========================

<div class="caution">

<p><b>You might overwrite any hard disk on the computer.</b></p>

<p>If at some point you are not sure about which device to choose, stop proceeding.</p>

</div>

1. Make sure that the USB stick that you want to reset is unplugged.

1. Choose **Applications**&nbsp;▸ **Utilities**&nbsp;▸ **Disks** to start the
   *Disks* utility.

   A list of all the storage devices on the computer appears in the left pane
   of the window.

1. Plug in the USB stick that you want to reset.

   A new device appears in the list of storage devices. This new device
   corresponds to the USB stick that you plugged in. Click on it.

1. In the right pane of the window, verify that the device corresponds
   to the USB stick that you want to reset, its brand, its size, etc.

1. To reset the USB stick, click on the <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/open-menu.png alt="Menu" class=symbolic link=no]]</span> button
   in the titlebar and choose <span class="guilabel">Format Disk…</span>.

1. In the <span class="guilabel">Format Disk</span> dialog:

   1. If you want to erase all data securely, choose to
   **Overwrite existing data with zeroes** in the
   **Erase** menu.

   2. Choose **Compatible with all systems and devices (MBR/DOS)**
   in the **Partitioning** menu.

   3. Click on the **Format…** button.

1. In the confirmation dialog, click on the <span class="bold">Format</span>
   button to confirm.

1. To make sure that all the changes are written to the USB stick, click on the
   <span class="guimenu">[[!img lib/media-eject.png alt="Eject" class=symbolic link=no]]</span>
   button in the titlebar.

Resetting a Tails USB stick from itself
=======================================

If Tails is your only Linux system, you can generally reset a Tails USB stick
directly from that USB stick while running Tails.

1.  When starting Tails, add the <span class="command">toram</span> boot
    option in the <span class="application">Boot Loader</span>. For detailed
    instructions, see the documentation on [[using the <span
    class="application">Boot Loader</span>|advanced_topics/boot_options]].

2.  If Tails starts as usual, follow the instructions for [[resetting a USB stick
    using the *Disks* utility|linux#disks]].

    **If the system fails to start**, that means that the computer does not have
    enough memory for this operation mode. Try with another computer, or find
    another Linux system, such as another Tails USB stick, to do the reset from.
