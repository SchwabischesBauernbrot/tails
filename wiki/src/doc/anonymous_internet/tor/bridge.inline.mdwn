  To request a custom bridge, you can either:

  1. Request a bridge on [https://bridges.torproject.org/](https://bridges.torproject.org/bridges?transport=obfs4).

     We recommend doing so before starting Tails and ideally from a different
     local network than the one on which you want to hide that you are using
     Tor.

  1. Send an empty email to
     <a href="mailto:bridges@torproject.org">bridges@torproject.org</a> from a
     Gmail or Riseup email address.

     For example, you can send the email from your phone and type the bridge in Tails.

     Sending the email reveals to Gmail or Riseup that you are trying to
     connect to Tor but not to someone who monitors your Internet connection.

     Even someone who knows your bridge cannot know what you are doing online
     from Tails.

  1. Send the message `/bridges` to
     [@GetBridgesBot](https://t.me/GetBridgesBot) on *Telegram*.
