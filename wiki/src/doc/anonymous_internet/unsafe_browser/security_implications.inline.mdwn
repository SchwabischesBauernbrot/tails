The *Unsafe Browser* does not use Tor. The websites that you visit can
see your real IP address.

This is why we recommend that you:

- Only use the *Unsafe Browser* to sign in to a network using a captive portal
  or [[browse trusted web pages on the local
  network|advanced_topics/lan#browser]].

- Close the *Unsafe Browser* after signing in to the network.

  <p>It is particularly important that you close the <i>Unsafe Browser</i> if
  you use accessibility features like the Screen Keyboard or the Screen Reader.
  If you keep the <i>Unsafe Browser</i> open, a very advanced network attacker
  might use it to deanonymize you.</p>
