[[!meta title="Error while checking for upgrades"]]

Tails could not determine whether an upgrade is available from our website.
This is most likely caused by a network connection problem.

To solve it:

1. Check your network connection and restart Tails to check for upgrades again.

1. Read our [[release notes|doc/upgrade/release_notes]] to see if
   there are known issues with automatically upgrading to the latest version of
   Tails.

1. If the problem persists, do a [[manual upgrade|doc/upgrade#manual]].
