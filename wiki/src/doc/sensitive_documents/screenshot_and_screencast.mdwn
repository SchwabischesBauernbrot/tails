<div class="bug">

<p>Unfortunately, this screencast has no sound and more complete applications
like <i>Kazam</i> stopped working in Tails 5.8 (December 2022). Tails 6.0 (mid
2023) should integrate better screencast features. ([[!tails_ticket 19441]])<p>

<p>Until then, you can record the sound with <i>Sound Recorder</i>.</p>
