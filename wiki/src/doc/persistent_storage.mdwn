[[!meta title="Persistent Storage"]]

Everything you do disappears automatically when you shut down Tails.

But you can save some of your files and configuration in a Persistent
Storage on your Tails USB stick. For example:

- Your documents
- Your Wi-Fi passwords
- Your brower bookmarks
- And so on

The Persistent Storage is an encrypted partition protected by a passphrase
that occupies all the free space left on the USB stick.

You can choose to unlock your Persistent Storage or not each time you
start Tails.

<div class="caution">

<p>Using the Persistent Storage can have security implications
in a system like Tails, which is designed to provide
anonymity and leave no trace.
