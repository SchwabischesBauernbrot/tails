echo "Merging /lib/firmware â†’ /usr/lib/firmware"

# In recent Debian firmware packages (that we install from Sid) the
# blobs have been migrated from /lib/firmware to /usr/lib/firmware which
# works fine on a usr-merged system where /lib is a symlink to /usr/lib,
# so both actually are the same directory. But in Tails 5.x, which isn't
# usr-merged, this results in the firmwares being split among these
# directories, and in the end only those in /lib/firmware are included
# in the initramfs.
#
# To fix this we implement a partial usr-merge: only /lib/firmware is
# merged into /usr/lib/firmware, and then replaced with a symlink to
# that directory.
rsync --archive --remove-source-files /lib/firmware/ /usr/lib/firmware/
# With --remove-source-files it is expected that folders remain in the
# source, but the following command will clean them up. It will fail
# if there is any non-empty folder, as a sanity check.
find /lib/firmware -type d -delete
ln -s /usr/lib/firmware /lib/firmware
