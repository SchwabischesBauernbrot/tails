## We have switched to Arti but for now we keep an arbitrary tor
## SocksPort so tor can bootstrap which currently is needed for
## tails-tor-has-bootstrapped.target to be reached and for TCA to be
## able to succeed.
SocksPort 127.0.0.1:19050

## The port on which Tor will listen for local connections from Tor
## controller applications, as documented in control-spec.txt.
ControlPort 127.0.0.1:9052

## Transparent proxy
TransPort 127.0.0.1:9040

## Enable the Seccomp sandbox. It will disabled later (by the
## tor-pt-configuration-helper) if we configure any pluggable transport
## in TCA; note that old-school "simple" bridges will still
## have the sandbox enabled.
